# Alerts Wizard

CIPP offers a set of scheduled, recurring alert checks. Some of these duplicate Microsoft Alerts functionality in a more MSP-friendly manner, some are not available as a Microsoft Alert at this time.

Within CIPP, there are two types of alerts.

* Scripted CIPP Alert
* Audit Log Alert

Similar to [Tenant Standards](../standards/edit-standards.md#meet-the-standards), you configure alerts using the wizard to select one or more tenants or -All Tenants- to apply alerts globally, then select from the list of available alerts.

Alert email delivers to the email address or webhook provided in CIPP settings. Alerts are delivered as an HTML-formatted table. Alerts fire once per incident - for example, a full mailbox does not fire an alert every time it's checked.

{% hint style="info" %}
Scripted CIPP Alerts runtimes are configurable from 30 minutes to up to 1 week.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Audit Log Alerts are processed in near real-time.
{% endhint %}
